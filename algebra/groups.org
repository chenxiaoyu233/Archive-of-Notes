* Summary
  When I am reading this book, I find it is so easy for me to forget the concepts
  that I was learn before. Because the amount of them are incredible.
  So, I record some important concepts and their definition here.
  
* Logical Prerequisites
** map
   If $f: A\mapsto B$ is a mapping of one set into another, we write
   \[x \mapsto f(x)\] to denote the effect of $f$ on an element $x$ of $A$.
** injective
   We say that $f$ is *injective* if $x\not=y$ implies $f(x)\not=f(y)$.
** surjective
   We say $f$ is *surjective* if given $b\in B$ there exists $a\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$.
** bijective
   We say $f$ is *bijective* if it is both surjective and injective.
** restriction of map
   We say the restriction of $f$ to $A'$ is a map of $A'$ into $B$ denoted by $f|A'$.
** composite map
   If $f: A\mapsto B$ and $g: B\mapsto C$ are maps, then we have a composite map $g\circ f$
   such that $(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$ for all $x\in A$.
** image of $f$
   Let $f:A\mapsto B$ be a map, and $B'$ a subset of $B$. By $f^{-1}(B')$ we mean the subset
   of $A$ consisting of all $x\in A$ such that $f(x)\in B'$. We call it the *inverse image* of 
   $B'$. We call $f(A)$ the image of $f$.
** commutative

* Monoids
** law of composition
   A mapping $S\times S \to S$ is sometimes called a *law of composition* (of $S$ into itself).
** associative
   $(xy)z = x(yz)
** unit element
   $e\in S$, and $ex = x = xe$ for all $x\in S$. Then $e$ is a unit element.
** monoid
   a *monoid* is a set $G$, with a law of composition which is associative, and having a unit element.
** commutativity
   $xy = yx$.
** commutative (or abelian)
   If the law of compositive of $G$ is commutative, we also say that $G$ is *commutative (or abelian)*.
** almost all
   All but a finite number.
** submonoid
   By a *submonoid* of $G$, we shall mean a subset $H$ of $G$ containing the unit element $e$,
   and such that, if $x, y \in H$ then $xy \in H$ (we say that $H$ is *closed* under the law of 
   composition). It is then clear that $H$ is itself a monoid, under the law of composition indeuced
   by that of $G$.
* Group
** group
   A *group* $G$ is a monoid, such that for every element $x\in G$, there exists an element $y\in G$
   such that $xy = yx = e$.
** inverse
   An *inverse* for $x$ is an element $y\in G$ such that $xy = yx = e$.
   Sometimes $y$ is denoted by $x^{-1}$.
** direct product
   $G_1 \times G_2 = \{(x, y) | \forall x\in G_1, \forall y\in G_2\}$
** generators
   Let $G$ be a group and $S$ a subset of $G$. We shall say that $S$ *generates* $G$, or $S$ is 
   a set of $generators$ for $G$, if every element of $G$ can be expressed as a product of
   element in $S$ or a inverse of element in $S$.
** homomorphism
   A (monoid/group)-*homomorphism* of $G$ into $G'$ is a mapping $f: G\mapsto G'$ such that $f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$.
** isomorphism
   A homomorphism $f:G\mapsto G'$ is called an *isomorphism* if there exists a homomorphism
   $g: G'\mapsto G$ such that $f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$ are the identity mappings.
   This is sometimes denoted by $G' \approx G$.
** automorphism
   A isomorphism from $G$ to $G$.
** endomorphism
   A homomorphism from $G$ to $G$.
** power map
   The map $x\mapsto x^n$ is called the n-th *power map*.
** kernel
   Let $f: G\mapsto G'$ be a group-homomorphism.
   We define the *kernel* of $f$ to be the subset of $G$ consisting of all $x$ such that $f(x) = e'$.
** embedding
   A homomorphism $f: G\mapsto G'$ which establish an isomorphism between $G$ and its image in $G'$
   will also be called an embedding.
** left (right) coset
   A *left coset* of $H$ in $G$ is a subset of $G$ of type $aH$, for some element $a\in G$.
** coset representative
   An element of $aH$ is called a *coset representative* of $aH$.
** index
   The number of (left) coset of $H$ in $G$ is called the (left) *index* of $H$ in $G$,
   and is denoted by $(G:H)$.
   The index of the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$ is called the *order* of $G$ ($(G:1)$).
* Normal Subgroups
** normal subgroup
   Let $G$ be a group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
   If $H$ satisfies $H \subset xHx^{-1}$ for all the $x\in G$.
   Then $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
** canonical map
   If $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
   Then, the constructed map $f: G\to G/H$ is called *canonical map*.
   And $G/H$ is called the *factor group* of $G$ by $H$.
   canonical map is often denoted by $\varphi$.
** normalizer
   Let $S$ be a subset of $G$ and let $N = N_s$ be the set of 
   all elements $x\in G$ such that $xSx^{-1} = S$. Then N
   is called the *normalizer* of $S$.
** centralizer
   Let $S$ be a subset of $G$.
   *Centralizer* $C$ is the set of all the elements in $G$ such that
   $\forall x\in S, \forall y\in C, yxy^{-1} = x$.
   The centralizer of $G$ itself is called *center* of $G$.
** tower
   Let $G$ be a group. A sequence of subgroups
   $G = G_0 \supset G_1 \supset G_2 \supset \cdots \supset G_m$
   is called a *tower* of subgroups.
** normal tower
   a tower is said to be normal if each $G_{i+1}$ is normal in $G_i$.
** abelian tower
   a tower is said to be abelian if it is normal and if each factor 
   group $G_i/G_{i+1}$ is abelian.
** cyclic tower
   a tower is said to be cyclic if it is normal and if each factor 
   group $G_i/G_{i+1}$ is cyclic.
** refinement of a tower
   a refinement of a tower is a tower which can be obtained by inserting
   a finite number of subgroups in the given tower.
** solvable group
   a group is said to be solvable if it has abelian tower, whose
   last element is the trivial subgroup({e}).
** commutator
   a *commutator* in $G$ is a group element os the form $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$.
   with $x, y\in G$.
** commutator subgroup
   a commutator subgroup $C^C$ of $G$ is a subgroups generates by the 
   commutators.
** simple group
   a group is said to be *simple* if it is non-trivial.

* Cyclic Groups
** cycilc group
   Let $G$ be a group. $G$ is cyclic if there exists an element
   $a$ of $G$ such that every element $x$ of $G$ can be written
   in the form $a^n$ for some $n\in Z$.
   $a$ is called the generator of $G$.
** exponent of an element
   Let $G$ be a group.
   For $a\in G$, if $a^m = e$, then we say $m$ is a exponent of $a$.
   If all the elements in $G$ has the exponent $m$, then we say that $G$ as exponent $m$.
** period of an element
   $d$ is the smallest positive exponent of $a$.
   Then $d$ is called the period of $a$.
* Operations Of A Group On A Set
** operation/action of group $G$ on set $S$.
   An operation of $G$ on $S$ is a homomorphism:
   \[\pi: G\to Perm(S) \]. 
   We then call $S$ a $G$-set
** conjugation
   $G\to Aut(G)$ is called a conjugation.
   its kernel is called the *center* of $G$.
** conjugate
   $A, B$ are two subsets of $G$. we say that they are
   *conjugate* if there exists $x\in G$ such that $B = xAx^{-1}$.
** morphism of $G$-set / $G$-map
   Let $S, S'$ be two $G$-sets, and $f:S\to S'$ a map.
   We say that $f$ is a *morphism* of $G$-sets, or a $G$-map
   if $f(xs) = xf(s)$ for $x\in G$ and $s\in S$.
** iostropy
   The set of elements $x\in G$ such that $xs = s$ is obviously
   a subgroup of $G$, called the $isotropy$.
   (denoted by $G_s$).
** faithful / fixed point (P28)
** orbit
   Let $G$ operate on a set $S$. Let $s\in S$. The subset
   of $S$ consisting of all elements $xs$ (with $x\in G$) is
   denoted by $G_S$, and is called the *orbit* of $s$ under $G$.
** transitive
   an operation of $G$ on $S$ is said to be *transitive*
   if there is only one orbit.
* Sylow Subgroups
** p-group
   a finite group whose order is a power of $p$.
** p-subgroup
   Let $G$ be a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of it.
   we call $h$ a p-subgroup os $G$ if $H$ is a p-group.
** p-Sylow subgroup
   We call $H$ a p-Sylow subgroup if the order of $H$ is $p^n$ and if $p^n$ is the hightest
   power of $p$ deviding the order of $G$.
* Direct Sums and Free Abelian Groups
** direct sum
   Let $\{a_i\}_{i\in i}$ be a family of abelian groups. we define their *direct sum*
   \[A = \bigoplus_{i\in I} A_i\] to be the subset of the direct product $\prod a_i$ consisting of all 
   families $(x_i)_{i\in i}$ with $x_i\in a_i$ such that $x_i = 0$ for all but a 
   finite nunber of indices $i$.
** basis
   Let $A$ be an abelian group. Let $\{e_i\}(i\in I)$ be a family of elements of
   $A$. We say that this family is a *basis* for $A$ if the family
   and if every element of $A$ has a unique expression as a linear combination
   \[ x = \sum x_ie_i \] with $x_i\in Z$ and almost all $x_i = 0$.
** free abelian group
   An abelian group is said to be *free* if it has a basis.
** free abelian group generated by $S$
   We shall denote $Z\langle S \rangle$ also by $F_{ab}(S)$, 
   and call $F_{ab}(S)$ the *free abelian group generated by $S$*.
   we call elements of $S$ its *free generators*.
